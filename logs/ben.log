Trying to find out if the idea is actually possible to implement:
	- What is the role of the training data:
		- Seems to be generated by function:
			auto data = generate_training_data(gen_mixture, n_data); in nanopolish_test.cpp 466
			also generated in 344 of same file
		- TransitionTrainingData defined as struct in src/hmm/nanopolish_transition_parameters.h:27
